/*
A Customer is a Person that will print name " is browsing through" in its performTask method.
It also has a method speak(Employee) where it will print "Oh, hello, [employee name]. Can you assist me?", except
when the Employee is a Developer and the Customer's age is more than the Developer's age, in which
case it will instead ask "Can I see your manager [name of manager]?"

cos > dev age
Can I see your manager [name of manager]?

Oh, hello, [employee name]. Can you assist me?
