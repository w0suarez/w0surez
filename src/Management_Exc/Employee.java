/*
The Employee is a Person that has the following field: double salary.
Create a public getter and a protected
setter for this field. The Employee's performTask() will simply print the following: name " is working".
Whenever an Employee is printed, it would also have its salary listed after, i.e., "name (age) - salary", and
there is no particular formatting for the salary's decimal places.
As we attempt to promote reusability, try
not to implement the same printing of the name and age again, but instead use the concept of inheritance,
similar to the other tasks in this problem.


For the salary, make sure that it cannot go lower than 30,000. If it does, throw an
IllegalArgumentException with message “Salary must be greater than or equal to 30000”
